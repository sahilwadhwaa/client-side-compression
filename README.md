# Client-Side Video Compression Demo

This project is a React application that demonstrates **client-side video compression** using the [WebCodecs API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API) for modern browsers, with a fallback to the [MediaRecorder API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder_API) for broader compatibility. The app features an upload widget that allows users to select a video file, compress it directly in the browser, and preview or download the result‚Äîall without uploading the video to a server.

## Features

- üì¶ **Client-side compression**: No server upload required.
- üöÄ **WebCodecs API**: Uses hardware-accelerated H.264/AAC encoding when available.
- üîÑ **MediaRecorder fallback**: Ensures compatibility on browsers without WebCodecs.
- üéõÔ∏è **Customizable presets**: Easily adjust compression settings.
- ‚ö° **Fast and private**: All processing happens locally in your browser.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/client-side-compression.git
    cd client-side-compression
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**

## How It Works

### WebCodecs API

The WebCodecs API provides low-level access to media encoding and decoding components, enabling efficient, hardware-accelerated video and audio processing directly in the browser. In this app, WebCodecs is used to:

- Decode the uploaded video.
- Re-encode it using H.264 (video) and AAC (audio) codecs.
- Mux the result into an MP4 file using the **mediabunny** library.

### MediaRecorder API Fallback

If the browser does not support WebCodecs, the app falls back to the MediaRecorder API:

- The video is drawn frame-by-frame onto a `<canvas>`.
- Audio is captured using the Web Audio API.
- Both streams are combined and recorded using MediaRecorder, producing a WebM or MP4 file (depending on browser support).

## Core Components

- **UploadWidget**: The main UI component for file selection and compression.
- **compressVideo**: Handles the logic for choosing between WebCodecs and MediaRecorder.
- **compressWithWebCodecs**: Implements compression using WebCodecs.
- **compressWithMediaRecorder**: Implements compression using MediaRecorder.
